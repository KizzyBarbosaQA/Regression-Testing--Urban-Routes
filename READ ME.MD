## Urban Routes - Regression Testing

### App Overview
**Urban Routes** is a route planning app that helps users plan trips and calculate the total time and cost for different modes of transportation. The interface allows the user to input two addresses ("From" and "To") and choose from three travel modes: **Optimal**, **Flash**, and **Personal**. Additionally, the app offers multiple transport options, including personal car, walking, taxi, bike, scooter, and car-sharing.

After entering the departure and destination points, the app uses an algorithm to calculate the **estimated time** and **cost** of the trip, providing users with a clear and practical view of their travel options.

## Objective
This project aims to perform a **comprehensive regression test** on Urban Routes, ensuring that new updates or bug fixes do not affect the app's existing functionalities. As Urban Routes plays a critical role in users' mobility experiences, identifying and fixing errors quickly is crucial to maintaining its user base.

## QA Analyst Responsibilities
- Conduct **regression tests** on all functionalities of Urban Routes.
- Validate the correct functioning of route calculations and transportation options.
- Verify that the travel modes (Optimal, Flash, Personal) are operating as expected.
- Find **bugs** (discrepancies between expected and actual results).
- **Report** all found bugs to the development team, ensuring they are fixed quickly.
- Ensure a high-quality user experience is maintained after each update.

## Skills Acquired

- Learning and applying **regression testing techniques** in a dynamic route-planning app environment.
  
- Checklist creation
  
- Test case development
  
- Bug report creation
  
- Strengthened ability to work with **agile methodologies** (Scrum), ensuring continuous delivery of high-quality software.
